#Planning Your Intermediate Engineering Year

**Author: Hayley van Waas, University of Canterbury, September 2015**

This is an interactive webpage designed to help students in selecting which papers to take for first year engineering at the University of Canterbury.

### To edit the table rules
The page works according to rules specified in dictionaries in script.js. One dictionary specifies subjects required for each engineering discipline, and the other specifies which subjects are available in each semester. To change the rules, simply edit these dictionaries.

The initial rules were taken directly from the Intermediate Courses Advisor spreadsheet.

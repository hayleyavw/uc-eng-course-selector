        <h1>Planning Your Intermediate Engineering Year</h1>

        <!-- instructions -->
        <p>
            Click on the engineering disciplines you are interested in. The table will show you which subjects are needed to qualify for all the disciplines you selected.
            <br>
            Note that some engineering disciplines have similar/the same requirements. If you did not select a discipline but it is highlighted, this means that with the current subject selection you are also eligible for this discipline.
            <br>
            If a subject is available in multiple semesters, you can choose which semester you would prefer to take it in (although some subjects will have prerequisites).
            <br>
            Subjects will be highlighted in yellow if you have selected more than the recommended four subjects per semester.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <div id="note">
            <p>Note:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
            The table assumes that you have achieved University Entrance and some subjects will assume that you have taken a specific subject at NCEA Level 3 (e.g. PHYS101 requires 14 credits in Level 3 Physics).
                <li>If you have/are expecting an Excellent Endorsement in any subject, consult Student Advisors as you may be eligible for a Modified Intermediate.
                <li>ENGR100 is an Academic Writing Assessment and is an EFTS free, zero-fee course.
                <li>If you have selected less that four subjects per semester, you must select courses to fill them. A second science course such as PHYS102, CHEM112 or COSC122 is a good idea to keep a pathway open into a related BSc major. Other popular choices are management or geological sciences but you may take courses from other science, forestry, arts, humanities, health, education or law subjects.

        <!-- instructions -->
        <p>
            Click on the engineering disciplines you are interested in. The table will show you which subjects are needed to qualify for all the disciplines you selected.
            <br>
            If a subject is available in multiple semesters, you can choose which semester you would prefer to take it in (although some subjects will have prerequisites).
            <br>
            Subjects will be highlighted in yellow if you have selected more than the recommended four subjects per semester.
            <br>
            If you select papers that cover requirements for disciplines which you did not select, they will also be highlighted.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note: ENGR100 is an Academic Writing Assessment and is an EFTS free, zero-fee course.
